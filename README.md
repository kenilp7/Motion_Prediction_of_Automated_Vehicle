# SeminarEM_MotionPrediction

Python code for LEM summer term seminar with the topic motion prediction in road scenarios

## Getting started
- On Windows, open powershell (search in the start menu, you might have never used it before)
- On Linux (haha), open a terminal by pressing `CTRL + ALT + T`
- Navigate to this folder. Hint: You move into the next folder by using `cd foldername` and you step out of your current folder by typing `cd..`. "cd" means "change directory". 

- (On Linux click to this folder, then right click and `open in terminal`)

- Now type or copy `pip install -r requirements.txt` and hit `ENTER`. This will now install all the Python packages you are going to need.

- After everything is successfully installed open Jupyter-Lab by entering `jupyter lab` in your terminal.

- If you have problems try to google the error message quickly. Most problem are solved with a quick search. Whether or not this was helpful and solved your problem, shoot us an email and tell your story briefly. We will help you or change something in the requirements, so that the problem doesn't show up in the future. 

## After you have received your dataset
- Just copy everything and paste it into the folder `dataset`. Prevent copying the top folder of the .zip you are going to receive. In the end, when you open the folder `dataset` you should directly see a bunch of files and not one folder.

## Start your data science career!

- Navigate to the example in the folder `code`.

- Start `jupyter lab` and open within Jupyter-Lab `main.ipynb` by navigating through the file browser on the left.

- Click through the example and read/watch the provided resources!

- Try to edit this example to implement your ideas!

# May the best data scientist win the competition!!
